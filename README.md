Exercise 1: Make
================

This is the first exercise in COP4600 Spring 2016. Your task is
to write a `Makefile` with the following rules:

1. A wildcard rule to compile `.c` files to `.o`
2. A rule `hello` that compiles the binary from the `.o` files
3. A rule `clean` that restores the project to its initial state
